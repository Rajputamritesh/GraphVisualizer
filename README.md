//how to use
set the pointer where you want .
click on the playground area and move your mouse to construct walls ..after making walls just click on the whatever algorith,dikstra or backtracking you want to see.
Note:Backtracking algo works in 2 destination pointer finding euclidean distance between the nodes. but Dikstra works in case of 1 destination pointer (yet to be implmented for more than 2 pointer will update soon or it would be great if you guys contribute to it :)).

â€¢	Graph-PathFindingVisualizer(using only html, js ,css on React Framework):A path finding visualizer that find the shortest paths between 2 or more nodes,works like uber pool when more than 2 nodes ,this is done by finding the Euclidean distances between start node and destNodes. .It works on  my own algorithm that is designed and implemented by me using Backtracking and recursive approach. Also I have implemented the idea on dikstra algorithm.The algorithm are designed in a manner that takes care and avoid walls  that is made by the user in the playground area.
